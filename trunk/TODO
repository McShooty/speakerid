1. MODEL INITIALIZATION:
	p = 1/nGaussians           OK
	m = normally distributed   OK
	s = normally distributed   OK

	In the future: K-Means

2. TRAINING STOP
	Based on convergence rate instead of number of epochs. OK

3. CONFIGURATION READING:
	a) Output filename                           OK
	b) Number of gaussians                       OK
	c) Filenames of files with feature vectors   OK
	d) Dimension of feature vectors              OK

4. READING TRAINING UTTERANCES FROM FILES
	Changes must be made in all functions to allow training with multiple utterances.
	Instead of this, firstly, the program will read all utterances and wil store them 
	altoghether in a single variable. This should not be a big problem, since usually 
	the gmms are trained with small amounts of data.
